Hub Purpose,multiple_choice,In Data Vault," what is the primary purpose of a ""Hub""?",2,1,0.25,A Hub stores the unique business key and provides a consistent anchor for relationships.,To track changes in descriptive attributes,To represent a business key in a consistent format,To link satellites and bridges,To store relationship data between business keys,
Satellite Role,multiple_choice,Which of the following components is used to store context and descriptive information in a Data Vault model?,3,1,0.25,Satellites store historical and descriptive attributes related to hubs or links.,Hub,Link,Satellite,PIT Table,,
Link Function,multiple_choice,What is the main function of a Link in a Data Vault model?,2,1,0.25,"Links represent relationships between business keys (hubs), often many-to-many.",Store business metadata,Connect multiple Hubs to form relationships,Store historical attribute data,Represent physical table lineage,,
Hash Key Use,multiple_choice,Why are hash keys used in Data Vault modeling?,2,1,0.25,Hash keys provide a consistent and surrogate key mechanism to manage business keys.,To speed up database lookups using joins,To ensure unique business key representation and avoid natural key issues,To compress data for efficient storage,To encrypt business-sensitive information,,
Hash Collision Risk,multiple_choice,What is a potential issue with hash keys in Data Vault?,3,1,0.25,Hash collisions can occur when two different inputs generate the same hash output.,Key inflation,Hash explosion,Collisions (different inputs resulting in same output),Compression loss,,
PIT Table Use,multiple_choice,What is the role of a PIT (Point-In-Time) table in Data Vault 2.0?,3,1,0.25,PIT tables simplify querying across multiple satellite tables by aligning their timelines.,Store relationships between hubs,Capture only the latest records,Enable efficient point-in-time querying across multiple satellites,Replace historical satellite records,,
Bridge vs PIT,multiple_choice,What distinguishes a Bridge table from a PIT table in Data Vault?,2,1,0.25,Bridge tables handle many-to-many relationships and summarizations for reporting.,Bridge tables contain business rules, while PIT tables don’t,Bridge tables pre-aggregate many-to-many relationships for reporting,PIT tables are used for zero-copy publish,Bridge tables replace links and hubs,
Raw to Business Vault,multiple_choice,What does the Raw → Business Vault pipeline achieve in DV 2.0 architecture?,2,1,0.25,This pipeline applies business rules on top of raw vault structures to make data analysis-ready.,Move data from sources to final reports,Apply business logic on top of raw vault structures,Convert links into hub structures,Create physical partitions for performance,,
DV Automation Macros,multiple_choice,In DV automation tools like dbt or WhereScape, what do macros typically help with?,2,1,0.25,"Macros automate the creation and update of patterns like Hubs, Links, and Sats.",Improve data compression,Automate repetitive DDL and DML patterns (e.g., Hub/Link/Sat creation),Replace PIT tables,Merge business keys directly
Zero-Copy Star Publish,multiple_choice,What is the goal of “Zero-Copy Star Publish” in the context of Data Vault?,2,1,0.25,It allows the creation of star schemas or dimensional models without physically duplicating data.,Publish raw vault tables directly without business logic,Create a dimensional model without duplicating data,Create a business vault without satellites,Replace star schemas with NoSQL databases,,
