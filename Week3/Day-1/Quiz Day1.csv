MicroBatchVsContinuous,direct,Which of the following statements correctly differentiates between micro-batch and continuous processing in Structured Streaming?,4,1,0,Micro-batch processes data in small batches whereas continuous processing operates on individual records with sub-millisecond latency.,Micro-batch processes data in real-time at record level,Continuous processing provides higher throughput than micro-batch,Micro-batch offers sub-millisecond latencies,Micro-batch processes data in small batches whereas continuous processing operates on individual records with sub-millisecond latency,,,,
WatermarkAndLatenessMath,direct,"If a watermark of 10 minutes is defined, and a record with event time 8 minutes late arrives, will it be processed?",2,1,0,"Watermarking allows late data up to the threshold defined; if data is later than the watermark (e.g., 10 mins), it is discarded.","Yes, always","Yes, only if it's within 10 minutes of lateness","No, watermark disables all late data","No, all data older than the watermark threshold is dropped",,,,
OutputModes,direct,Which output mode allows updating only changed rows in streaming aggregations?,3,1,0,Update mode outputs only changed rows whereas Append mode outputs only newly added rows.,Append mode,Complete mode,Update mode,Trigger once mode,,,,
CheckpointInternals,direct,What metadata is typically stored in a Structured Streaming checkpoint directory?,4,1,0,"Checkpointing stores metadata like offsets, schema info, and state to enable recovery on failure.",Only streaming offsets,Only schema definitions,Only streaming queries,"Offsets, state, and schema info",,,,
AutoLoaderSchemaInference,direct,"How does Auto Loader infer schema when using ""cloudFiles"" format in Databricks?",2,1,0,Auto Loader infers schema by sampling a subset of files and optionally allowing schema evolution.,From manually defined schema only,By sampling subset of files and enabling schema inference,Reads schema from catalog,Uses the latest file only to infer schema,,,,
StreamToDelta,direct,What happens when a Structured Streaming job writes to a Delta Lake table?,4,1,0,The stream is continuously appended (or updated) to the Delta table using the configured output mode.,Data is lost after termination,Only one-time ingestion is supported,Delta table is overwritten on each batch,Stream data is appended/updated in Delta using the specified output mode,,,,
TriggerTypes,direct,Which of the following triggers causes the streaming query to run only once and then stop?,1,1,0,"Trigger.Once processes all available data and then stops, unlike Trigger.ProcessingTime.",Trigger.Once,Trigger.Continuous(10 seconds),Trigger.AvailableNow,Trigger.ProcessingTime(5 seconds),,,,
GracefulRestart,direct,Why is checkpointing essential for achieving graceful restart in Spark Structured Streaming?,3,1,0,Checkpointing allows resuming from the last committed state (offsets and intermediate state).,It enables performance tuning,It re-runs the complete stream,It restores state and offsets to resume from last processed batch,It ensures watermark is reset to 0,,,,
KafkaEOSemantics,direct,What is required to enable exactly-once semantics when using Kafka as a sink in Structured Streaming?,4,1,0,Exactly-once delivery requires idempotent writes and checkpoint-based offset tracking.,Use Kafka commit log,Enable at-least-once delivery only,Use memory sink,Enable idempotent writes and checkpointed offset tracking,,,,
KafkaStretchLabConcept,direct,What is the most essential requirement for achieving exactly-once semantics when streaming from Kafka to Delta in a stretch lab setup?,4,1,0,"Using a Delta sink with checkpointing ensures offset tracking and atomic writes, which are critical for exactly-once semantics.",Use foreachBatch without checkpoints,Enable idempotent writes,Ignore checkpointing to reduce latency,Use Delta sink with checkpointing,,,,
