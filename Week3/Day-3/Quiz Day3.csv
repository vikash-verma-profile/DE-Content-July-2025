FlowFileProvenance,direct,What does the provenance event chain in Apache NiFi allow you to do?,3,1,0,The provenance event chain helps trace the complete lifecycle and origin of each FlowFile.,Control how FlowFiles are scheduled,Trigger custom workflows,Trace the origin and lifecycle of FlowFiles,Apply site-to-site replication,,,,
CoreProcessors,direct,Which of the following is a core processor used for ingesting data into Apache NiFi?,2,1,0,GetFile is a core processor used to ingest data from a file system into NiFi.,PutFile,GetFile,UpdateAttribute,RouteOnAttribute,,,,
BackpressurePrioritizer,direct,Why is back-pressure important in Apache NiFi dataflows?,1,1,0,Back-pressure prevents system overload by stopping data intake when thresholds are exceeded.,It schedules threads evenly,It monitors security rules,It compresses files before writing,It drops all queued FlowFiles,,,,
PrioritizerUsage,direct,What does a prioritizer do in Apache NiFi?,2,1,0,A prioritizer determines the order in which FlowFiles are processed when queues are full.,Distributes FlowFiles across clusters,Orders FlowFiles in a queue based on custom logic,Drops FlowFiles when backpressure hits,Deletes provenance data,,,,
TemplateRegistry,direct,How does the versioned flow registry help in NiFi development lifecycle?,3,1,0,Versioned flow registry allows consistent deployment and tracking of process group versions across environments.,It manages access policies only,It stores logs for pipelines,It tracks versions and enables deployment of flows,It replicates data across clusters,,,,
SiteToSite,direct,Which protocol does NiFi Site-to-Site communication use by default for secure data transfer?,2,1,0,HTTPS is the default protocol for secure Site-to-Site communication in NiFi.,SFTP,HTTPS,WebSockets,FTP,,,,
NiFiClusterBasics,direct,What is the role of the primary node in an Apache NiFi cluster?,3,1,0,"The primary node handles tasks that should be performed only once in the cluster, such as site-to-site receiving.",It is always the leader of all nodes,It executes all processors,It performs single-node operations like S2S input,It routes traffic to other nodes,,,,
ProvenanceQuery,direct,What type of information can you retrieve from the provenance data in Apache NiFi?,3,1,0,"You can track FlowFile content, attributes, lineage, and processor events.",Processor properties,Cluster logs,FlowFile content and lineage,Processor JVM stats,,,,
BackPressureThresholds,direct,Which thresholds control queue back-pressure in Apache NiFi?,1,4,0,0,Back-pressure is triggered when queue size exceeds object count or total size limits.,Object count,Processor memory,Thread wait time,Data size,,,
VersionControlFlows,direct,Which action is required before committing changes to a versioned process group in NiFi?,3,1,0,You must first stop processors and save changes before committing to version control.,Change remote port,Disable backpressure,Stop processors and commit,Clear queue and restart,,,,
