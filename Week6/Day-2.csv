Question 1,single-correct,Which Spark transformation is more efficient than groupByKey() for aggregations?,2,1,0,"reduceByKey() performs local aggregation before shuffle, reducing network traffic.",mapValues(),reduceByKey(),groupByKey(),flatMap()
Question 2,single-correct,In Spark SQL, which join strategy is best for joining a large fact table with a small dimension table?,3,1,0,"Broadcast joins replicate the small table to all nodes, avoiding shuffles.",Shuffle hash join,Sort merge join,Broadcast join,Nested loop join
Question 3,single-correct,Which Delta Lake feature ensures readers always see a consistent snapshot of data during writes?,1,1,0,"Delta Lake provides snapshot isolation using its transaction log.",Snapshot isolation,Schema evolution,Data skipping,Z-ordering
Question 4,single-correct,Why does Spark use DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) scheduling?,4,1,0,"DAG allows Spark to optimize execution plans and recover from stage failures efficiently.",It avoids serialization,It eliminates need for caching,It guarantees in-memory execution,It enables stage-wise fault tolerance and optimization
Question 5,single-correct,Which Spark storage level keeps RDDs in memory in deserialized format and spills to disk if needed?,2,1,0,"MEMORY_AND_DISK keeps RDDs deserialized in memory, spilling to disk when memory is insufficient.",MEMORY_ONLY,MEMORY_AND_DISK,DISK_ONLY,OFF_HEAP
Question 6,single-correct,Which Delta Lake feature enables efficient queries on specific columns by skipping irrelevant data files?,3,1,0,"Data skipping stores min/max stats for each file, enabling predicate pushdown.",Schema enforcement,Time travel,Data skipping,Z-ordering
Question 7,single-correct,Which Spark optimization adapts shuffle partition numbers at runtime based on data size?,1,1,0,"Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) dynamically adjusts shuffle partitions and join strategies.",Adaptive Query Execution,Whole-stage Codegen,Broadcast join,Z-Ordering
Question 8,single-correct,In SQL, which clause is required when using aggregate functions with non-aggregated columns?,2,1,0,"The GROUP BY clause ensures that non-aggregated columns are grouped before aggregation.",ORDER BY,GROUP BY,HAVING,PARTITION BY
Question 9,single-correct,What does Whole-Stage Code Generation in Spark achieve?,3,1,0,"It fuses multiple operators into a single optimized Java function, reducing virtual function overhead.",It skips shuffle operations,It eliminates need for caching,It reduces CPU overhead by fusing operators,It improves network compression
Question 10,single-correct,Which command allows you to view historical versions of a Delta table?,4,1,0,"DESCRIBE HISTORY <table> shows operation history with versions and timestamps.",SHOW HISTORY <table>,SELECT * FROM delta.history,<table>.history,DESCRIBE HISTORY <table>
