Question 1,single-correct,What is a Flowlet in Azure Data Factory?,1,1,0,A Flowlet is a reusable transformation logic block used in multiple data flows.,Reusable transformation block,Partition filter,Linked Service connector,Pipeline trigger
Question 2,single-correct,Which benefit does Flowlet reuse provide?,2,1,0,Flowlets enable modular design and reduce redundancy in transformation logic.,Improves debug logs,Promotes reuse and modularity,Triggers external events,Applies managed identity
Question 3,single-correct,What does a Derived Column transformation do?,3,1,0,Derived Column allows adding or modifying columns using expressions.,Deletes rows,Sorts columns,Creates or updates column values with expressions,Creates partitions
Question 4,single-correct,Which transformation should you use to route data based on a condition?,4,1,0,Conditional Split allows branching based on expression logic.,Assert Row,Derived Column,Join,Conditional Split
Question 5,single-correct,What is the purpose of the Assert transformation in a data flow?,2,1,0,It is used for data quality enforcement by validating row-level conditions.,Load rows in parallel,Validate data against conditions and fail if not met,Stage rows to sink,Encrypt column values
Question 6,single-correct,How does staging in a sink help performance in data flows?,1,1,0,Staging allows better parallelism and performance for large sinks like SQL or Synapse.,Improves write performance and supports bulk loading,Enables debug mode,Replaces integration runtime,Encrypts sink data
Question 7,single-correct,Why would you partition your sink in Mapping Data Flows?,2,1,0,Sink partitioning allows parallel writing and reduces write bottlenecks.,To increase encryption,To enable parallelism during writes,To avoid alert rules firing,To create linked services
Question 8,single-correct,What is the use of Debug mode in Mapping Data Flows?,3,1,0,Debug allows you to preview and inspect row-level data transformations.,Publish pipelines,Auto-scale IR,Preview and inspect transformation output,Encrypt results
Question 9,single-correct,How can you preview row-level output in a data flow?,4,1,0,Use the data preview option in Debug mode to inspect transformations.,Monitor hub,Alert tab,Copy activity view,Data preview in debug mode
Question 10,single-correct,Which is a best practice for tuning performance in Mapping Data Flows?,1,1,0,Push down filters early and use partitioning for large datasets.,Use source pushdown and partitioning,Always disable cache,Avoid using derived columns,Use self-hosted IR only
