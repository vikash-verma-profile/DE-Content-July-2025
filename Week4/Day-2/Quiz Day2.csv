Question 1,single-correct,Which of the following is NOT a type of Integration Runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory?,3,1,0,The three main types of IR are Azure, Self-hosted, and Azure-SSIS.,Azure IR,Self-hosted IR,Azure SQL IR,Azure-SSIS IR
Question 2,single-correct,What is a key difference between Self-hosted IR and Azure IR?,1,1,0,Self-hosted IR is required for accessing on-premises or private network data sources.,Self-hosted IR supports on-prem and private network access,Self-hosted IR has no access restrictions,Azure IR supports Key Vault only,Azure IR is always offline
Question 3,single-correct,Which authentication method allows secure secret reference from Key Vault in a linked service?,2,1,0,Managed Identity allows ADF to authenticate to Azure Key Vault securely.,Password-based login,Managed Identity,Manual key entry,OAuth token via header
Question 4,single-correct,How does a Dataset differ from a Linked Service in ADF?,4,1,0,A Linked Service defines the connection, while Dataset defines the schema or data structure.,Linked Service defines columns,Dataset stores credentials,Dataset triggers pipelines,Dataset defines schema; Linked Service defines connection
Question 5,single-correct,In Copy Activity, which setting allows data to be written in parallel for performance?,3,1,0,Enabling data partitioning allows parallel writes.,Logging level,Encryption key,Data partitioning,Self-hosted IR
Question 6,single-correct,Which Copy Activity feature helps to automatically retry a failed data movement?,1,1,0,The retry policy setting ensures resilience in data copying.,Retry policy setting,Data consistency check,Azure Monitor integration,Schedule trigger
Question 7,single-correct,What can be monitored in the Azure Data Factory Monitor Hub?,2,1,0,Pipeline runs, trigger runs, and activity-level status are all visible in Monitor Hub.,SQL execution plans only,Pipeline and trigger runs with activity details,Only datasets,Data preview only
Question 8,single-correct,What triggers an Alert Rule in Azure Data Factory?,3,1,0,Alerts are triggered based on metric thresholds such as pipeline failure count.,High data volume,Dataset mismatch,Pipeline run failure count,Unpublished pipelines
Question 9,single-correct,What is a cost-effective practice when configuring Integration Runtime?,1,1,0,Auto shutdown of unused Self-hosted IRs can save costs.,Use auto-pause for unused IRs,Always enable concurrency,Increase memory buffer size,Use nested pipelines
Question 10,single-correct,Where can you find detailed cost metrics related to Data Factory operations?,4,1,0,Azure Cost Analysis and Pricing Calculator provide breakdown by activity and IR usage.,Monitor Hub,Data Preview,Alert Rules,Azure Cost Analysis
