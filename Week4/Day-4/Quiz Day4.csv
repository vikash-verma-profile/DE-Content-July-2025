Question 1,single-correct,Which trigger type fires at fixed intervals regardless of pipeline success?,1,1,0,Schedule triggers run on a fixed time schedule and are independent of pipeline status.,Schedule trigger,Tumbling window trigger,Event Grid trigger,Dependency trigger
Question 2,single-correct,Which trigger ensures pipeline runs don't overlap and maintains state?,2,1,0,Tumbling Window triggers are stateful and prevent overlapping runs.,Schedule trigger,Tumbling Window trigger,Manual trigger,Event trigger
Question 3,single-correct,What is the key use case for Event Grid triggers in Azure Data Factory?,3,1,0,They react to external events like blob creation or messages.,Fixed-time scheduling,Chained pipeline runs,Reacting to events like blob creation,Daily job orchestration
Question 4,single-correct,Which trigger type allows you to start a pipeline based on completion of another pipeline?,4,1,0,Dependency triggers enable event-based chaining of pipelines.,Schedule trigger,Event Grid trigger,Tumbling trigger,Dependency trigger
Question 5,single-correct,What is exponential back-off in retry policy used for?,1,1,0,It prevents overwhelming a failing system by increasing delay between retries.,Increase delay between retries progressively,Reduce data volume,Notify Teams channel,Trigger alerts in Synapse
Question 6,single-correct,What does configuring a retry policy in a pipeline activity help with?,2,1,0,Retry policies improve fault tolerance and allow automatic reruns on failure.,Improves pipeline speed,Handles transient failures automatically,Adds alerts,Creates partitioned outputs
Question 7,single-correct,How can Azure Data Factory send notifications to Microsoft Teams?,3,1,0,You can use a Teams Incoming Webhook URL with a Web activity.,Using log analytics,Using Monitor Hub directly,Using a Web activity with Teams webhook,Using Event Grid only
Question 8,single-correct,What does the SLA dashboard in ADF or Synapse Pipelines display?,2,1,0,It helps track pipeline success/failure against defined service timelines.,Cost metrics,Pipeline performance vs SLA,Data preview statistics,Integration runtime usage
Question 9,single-correct,Which component is essential to configure in a Web activity to send Teams alert?,1,1,0,The Webhook URL is used to send message payloads to a Teams channel.,Teams Webhook URL,Key Vault path,Synapse connector,Retry policy
Question 10,single-correct,What is the main benefit of using Dependency triggers over Tumbling window triggers?,4,1,0,Dependency triggers are event-based and don't rely on fixed time intervals.,They support recurrence,They use scheduled frequency,They are for internal preview only,They enable chaining without time dependency
