Question 1,single-correct,Which Databricks feature allows you to pass values into a notebook at runtime?,2,1,0,"Notebook widgets enable runtime parameter passing through dropdowns, text, or multiselect inputs.",DBFS mounts,Notebook widgets,Cluster logs,Job libraries
Question 2,single-correct,Which DBUtils method retrieves a value passed from a Databricks job to a notebook?,1,1,0,`dbutils.widgets.get()` is used to read the value of a widget parameter in a notebook.,dbutils.widgets.get(),dbutils.jobs.get(),dbutils.fs.head(),dbutils.jobs.taskValues.get()
Question 3,single-correct,"When returning data from a notebook to a pipeline, which Databricks utility is most appropriate?",4,1,0,`dbutils.notebook.exit()` can return a JSON string or value to the calling job/pipeline.,dbutils.widgets.get(),dbutils.jobs.taskValues.get(),dbutils.fs.put(),dbutils.notebook.exit()
Question 4,single-correct,"In Databricks, which statement about job clusters vs. interactive clusters is correct?",2,1,0,"Job clusters are ephemeral and created specifically for running jobs, unlike always-on interactive clusters.",Job clusters are always running,Job clusters are created for a single job run,Interactive clusters are always ephemeral,Interactive clusters cannot run notebooks
Question 5,single-correct,What is the primary goal of cluster policies in Databricks?,3,1,0,Cluster policies enforce configuration rules and governance for cluster creation.,Increase DBFS storage speed,Reduce number of jobs per workspace,Enforce governance and cost controls on clusters,Enable streaming jobs only
Question 6,single-correct,Which is an example of a fan-out pattern in data processing workflows?,1,1,0,Processing one dataset into multiple downstream parallel tasks.,One input splits into multiple parallel tasks,Multiple inputs merge into one task,Single task executes sequentially,Single task sends output to single sink only
Question 7,single-correct,"In a fan-in graph pattern, what typically occurs?",2,1,0,Multiple upstream parallel tasks feed their results into a single downstream task.,One dataset triggers multiple downstream tasks,Multiple tasks converge into one downstream task,Tasks loop indefinitely,A single job runs multiple times in parallel
Question 8,single-correct,Which format is most suitable for returning structured results from a Databricks notebook to another job or pipeline?,3,1,0,Returning a JSON string allows easy parsing by downstream jobs or orchestration tools.,CSV file path,Text log output,JSON string,SQL view
Question 9,single-correct,What happens if a widget parameter expected by a Databricks notebook is missing at runtime?,4,1,0,The `dbutils.widgets.get()` call will throw an error if the widget is not found.,It returns an empty string,It defaults to null,It prompts the user to enter value,It throws an error
Question 10,single-correct,Why would you use `dbutils.jobs.taskValues` in a Databricks job?,2,1,0,To share values between tasks in a Databricks multi-task job workflow.,To list workspace jobs,To pass values between tasks in a job,To mount data sources,To monitor job status
